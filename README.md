# Random Password Generator

## DESCRIPTION

- This is a random password generator that will provide the user with various character options via browser prompts in order to select a randomized password

## Installation

- If you're reading this, that means you already have access to the code pushed to git

- However, if it looks like there is something we missed or could improve upon, feel free to clone our repository by clicking the green 'clone' button on the git, and copying the SSH key from the drop down menu. Once you've copied the SSH key you will need to go into your terminal and type 'git clone', paste the key, and hit enter.

  - Congrats! You've successfully made a working directory! This allows you to make alterations/additions to our code on your own local device.

## Usage

- The user will be presented with a landing page, in which they will find a container with a button labeled "Generate Password". Once the user clicks the button they will be presented with a window prompt, asking them to insert the desired amount of characters in their password, from 8 to 128. After, the user will be presented with four different confirmation windows containing prompts, confirming the inclusion of character case, numbers, and special characters.

## Credits

- I would like to thank all the teaching staff, my classmates, and Al Gore, without whom none of this would have been possible
